## Features

### Existing Features

The website consists of two sections.
Both sections feature a header and a footer.

![header](assets/docs/header.png)

![footer](assets/docs/footer.png)

#### Start Page

Start page contains:
* Simple quiz instructions. 
* Start Quiz button which opens the Quiz Page.
* Collection of paintings as a background to create the mood for art appreciation.

![Start Page](assets/docs/start-page.png)

#### Footer
Footer contains:
* Social media links. The links take the users to the home page of the social media platforms as the website doesn't have social media profiles yet.

![Footer](assets/docs/footer.png)

#### Quiz Section

Quiz section consists of:
* Image of the artwork.
* Question about the name of the artist.
* Three buttons with possible choices of the names.

![Quiz Page](assets/docs/quiz-page.png)

When one of the buttons is clicked it results in an alert window popping up on the screen:
* It states if the answer is correct.
* It also offers the user some further information anout the artist, the painting or the style.
* Once OK button is pressed, next question is loaded.

![Correct Answer Comment](assets/docs/correct-answer.png)
![Inorrect Answer Comment](assets/docs/incorrect-answer.png)

When user answers 3 questions an alert window informs them what percentage of their answers was correct.

### Potential Future Updates and Features

* Due to the time constraints Quiz only features three questions. Ideally I would like to expand it to at least 50 questions and increase amount of questions in the round to 5. 
* Presenting results in HTML rather than alert form.
* Introducing comments to the results depending on the score.
* Including a feature allowing users to share their results on social media.
* Downsizing images to improve performance.
* Customized 404 page.
